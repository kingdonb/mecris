# 🐕 Handoff Note: Boris & Fiona Walk Reminder Project

**For the next Claude agent with GitHub MCP access**

## 🎯 **Mission**
Get Boris and Fiona their walk reminders working! Kingdon has been paying for Twilio monthly but hasn't sent a single reminder yet. Time to ship this thing.

## 📋 **Current State**
- **GitHub Issue #19**: Complete spike documentation with architecture and code
- **GitHub Issue #13**: Parent issue for dog walking reminder system  
- **Code exists**: Full WASM implementation in `mecris/boris-fiona-walker/`
- **Blocker**: Spin configuration error (`missing field 'trigger'`)

## 🚀 **Your Mission**
1. **Read Issue #19** - It has the complete technical context, code walkthrough, and next steps
2. **Fix the Spin config** - The `spin.toml` is broken, needs proper trigger field
3. **Deploy to Spin Cloud** - Get it running on the free tier
4. **Test SMS delivery** - Verify Boris & Fiona reminders actually work
5. **Add missing features** - Beeminder check, weather awareness

## 💰 **Budget Context**
- **Target cost**: $2.25/month (SMS only, compute free)
- **Free tiers**: Spin Cloud, GitHub Actions  
- **Twilio**: Already set up and paid for monthly

## 🎪 **Architecture Vision**
```
GitHub Actions Cron → Spin Cloud WASM → Twilio SMS
       ↓                     ↓              ↓
   (free tier)          (free tier)    ($2.25/month)
   Hourly 2-6 PM       Instant exec    To Kingdon's phone
```

## 📁 **Code Location**
All implementation is in `mecris/boris-fiona-walker/` - Rust WASM module with:
- Time-aware reminders (2-6 PM Eastern only)
- Rate limiting (max 1 per day)
- Different messages for afternoon/golden hour/evening
- Twilio integration (needs config fix)

## 🔧 **Immediate Task**
Start with Issue #19 and get that Spin configuration working. The code is mostly complete, just needs the deployment pipeline fixed.

**Boris and Fiona are counting on you!** 🐕🐕

*This is a continuation of productive WASM/Spin Cloud research. The architecture is solid, just needs technical execution to ship.*
