# 🎯 Next Implementation Priorities

## CRITICAL: Missing for Control Loop
1. **Claude Code Monitor MCP** - Budget awareness (highest priority)
2. **Ping mechanism** - Scheduled autonomous wake-ups  
3. **Decision engine** - Ping → Context → Action logic

## High-Value Improvements
4. **Daily notes in narrator context** - Recent progress awareness
5. **Beeminder write-access controls** - Environment variable safety switch
6. **Context caching** - Reduce latency for large vaults

## Architecture Gaps Identified
- ❌ No daily note summarization in narrator context
- ❌ No progress trend analysis over time  
- ❌ No budget-aware decision making
- ❌ No temporal context beyond Beeminder deadlines
- ❌ Session logging exists but no breadcrumb retrieval system

## Testing Status
- 🔄 All MCP servers implemented but **untested**
- 🔄 No integration testing completed
- 🔄 Security review completed (Beeminder write access contained)

## Budget Context
- **$24 total budget, 7 days remaining**
- **Need Claude Code Monitor MCP for self-awareness**
- **Next session should focus on testing + Claude Code Monitor integration**
