# ðŸ“Š Daily Status Update â€“ 2025â€‘10â€‘19

## ðŸ“ˆ Overview
- **Budget**: ~$19.54 remaining (~â€¯â€‘20â€¯days left). **Critical** â€“ focus on highestâ€‘value work.
- **Active goals**: 5 (no pending todos).
- **Beeminder alerts**: `ellinika` â€“ derail risk in 3â€¯days (caution).
- **Daily activity**: No walk logged for the bike goal today â€“ a short walk is recommended.

## ðŸ“‚ Project: `boris-fiona-walker`
The walkâ€‘reminder system is **productionâ€‘ready** in terms of core functionality:
- 22/22 tests pass.
- WASM component builds and runs locally (`make dev`).
- Real Twilio credentials are loaded via `.envrc`.
- CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) is in place and ready to trigger hourly between 2â€‘6â€¯PMâ€¯ET.
- Documentation (`README.md`, `HANDOFF_PRODUCTION.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, etc.) is complete.

### âœ… Whatâ€™s already complete
- Core WASM reminder logic (timeâ€‘based, rateâ€‘limited, SMS delivery).
- Full test suite and CI workflow.
- Deployment tooling (`make deploy` â†’ Spin Cloud).
- Documentation and cost estimate (~$2.25/month for SMS).

### ðŸ“Œ What remains
| Issue # | Title | Status | Remaining Work |
|--------|-------------------------------|--------|----------------|
| **20** | Add Weather + Daylight Integration for Boris & Fiona Walk Reminders | **Planned** â€“ design is in `HANDOFF_PRODUCTION.md`. | Implement `src/weather.rs`, `src/daylight.rs`; update decision logic in `src/lib.rs`; add weatherâ€‘aware SMS templates; add tests. |
| **18** | Build Basic WASM Walk Reminder Module | Core code finished; only **deployment to Spin Cloud** and CI URL update are pending. | Run `make deploy`; update GitHub Actions workflow with real Spin Cloud URL; verify endâ€‘toâ€‘end SMS. |
| **16** | Documentation Architecture Implementation Complete | Already completed (checkâ€‘boxes ticked). | No pending work (kept for record). |
| **15** | Create Permanent Documentation Architecture | Ongoing â€“ permanent docs (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/â€¦`) still need content migration. | Populate permanent docs, retire attic files, ensure crossâ€‘references. |
| **14** | Complete Mecris Production Formalization | Not started â€“ Dockerisation, health monitoring, security audit, logging, backup, etc. are still to be done. | Containerisation, monitoring, security review, log rotation, backup procedures. |
| **12** | Integrate Tamagotchi Trainer & Stakpak Infrastructure | Planned â€“ no code yet. | Install Tamagotchi trainer, configure Stakpak, create feedback loop. |
| **11** | Implement Autonomous EC2 Deployment System | Planned â€“ no bootstrap script yet. | Write EC2 userâ€‘data script, MCP daemon, cron healthâ€‘checker, SMS heuristic, CloudWatch logging. |
| **10** | Setup GitHub Issue Label System for Documentation Lifecycle | Labels exist; need to ensure all issues are correctly labelled. | Apply missing labels, document usage. |

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Immediate Actions (given budget pressure)
1. **Deploy the core reminder to Spin Cloud** (`make deploy`). Verify a real SMS is sent.
2. **Update the GitHub Actions workflow** with the deployed Spin Cloud URL.
3. Once the core flow is confirmed, **focus on Issueâ€¯#20** (weather & daylight) because it adds user value without extra cost.
4. Keep **Issueâ€¯#18** open until the deployment step succeeds â€“ it will be closed afterward.
5. Track the budget daily; avoid unnecessary test runs that send extra SMS.

## ðŸš€ Next Milestones
- **Milestoneâ€¯1** â€“ Production deployment (â‰ˆâ€¯30â€¯min).
- **Milestoneâ€¯2** â€“ Weather & daylight integration (2â€‘3â€¯h).
- **Milestoneâ€¯3** â€“ MCP server integration (future session).
