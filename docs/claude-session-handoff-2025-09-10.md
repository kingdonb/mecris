# Claude Session Handoff - 2025-09-10

## Context When You Read This
You are continuing work on Mecris cost tracking reconciliation system. We just discovered the budget tracking has a "manual plug" that needs proper reconciliation workflow.

## What We Just Discovered

### Budget Tracking Reality
- **$19.54 remaining** = CORRECT (manual tracking of real Claude usage)
- **$5.46 actually spent** on Claude (25.00 - 19.54) = manually tracked, accurate
- **"Ghost" $5.31** = real Claude usage outside organization workspace (now fixed)
- **Manual "plug" system** = updating single budget row by hand (scripts/update_budget.sh)

### Current State
```json
{
  "claude_budget": {
    "database": "mecris_usage.db",
    "total": 24.96,
    "remaining": 19.54,
    "used": 5.42,
    "tracking_method": "manual updates to budget_tracking table"
  },
  "groq_usage": {
    "database": "mecris_virtual_budget.db", 
    "august_2025": 0.80,
    "september_2025": 0.80,
    "tracking_method": "odometer readings"
  },
  "session_tracking": {
    "only_captured": 0.11,
    "real_usage_not_auto_tracked": 5.31,
    "status": "broken - never connected to real API usage"
  }
}
```

## Your Mission (Where We Left Off)

1. **âœ… DONE**: Traced $19.54 source (manual budget tracking)
2. **âœ… DONE**: Found the $5.31 discrepancy (real usage not auto-tracked)  
3. **ðŸŽ¯ NEXT**: Review reconciliation system design

### Files to Review
- `billing_reconciliation.py` - Existing reconciliation system  
- `docs/comprehensive-multi-provider-billing-implementation.md` - Opus's design
- Current MCP endpoints (some unified endpoint missing from MCP)

### Goal
Design MCP-driven reconciliation workflow to replace manual `scripts/update_budget.sh`. Need to:
- Store the "plug" amount separately for books to square
- Create reconciliation flow through MCP server
- Tie out all numbers properly
- Maintain single source of truth for "how much budget left"

## Current Dashboard State (as of session end)

**MCP Endpoints Working**:
- `mcp__mecris__get_budget_status()` â†’ $19.54 remaining 
- `mcp__mecris__get_groq_status()` â†’ normal, 20 days until reset
- `mcp__mecris__get_narrator_context()` â†’ includes budget status

**Missing from MCP**: 
- `mcp__mecris__get_unified_cost_status` - was implemented but not in MCP manifest

**Reconciliation Need**:
- Manual plug of $5.31 (real Claude usage outside org workspace)  
- Need MCP workflow to update budget through reconciliation
- Books must tie out: API usage + manual plug = total spend

## Files Modified This Session
- `groq_odometer_tracker.py` - Added month parameter for historical records
- `mcp_server.py` - Added unified cost dashboard (but not in MCP manifest)
- Database - Added August 2025 Groq reading ($0.80)

## Next Steps When You Resume
1. Check current dashboard state from all endpoints
2. Review `billing_reconciliation.py` and docs
3. Design MCP reconciliation workflow  
4. Fix unified cost status MCP endpoint
5. Implement "tie out" reconciliation system
6. Test end-to-end workflow

## Key Insight
The manual system was working correctly all along - we just need to automate the reconciliation process and make the "plug" trackable for proper bookkeeping.

Budget is actually $19.54 remaining of $25.00 - this is accurate. âœ…
