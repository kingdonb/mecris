# Conversion Process (Issue 27)

## Purpose
Transform embedded task lists in markdown documents into first‑class GitHub Issues. This keeps the project backlog searchable, trackable, and visible in the GitHub UI while cleaning up documentation.

## Target Documents
- `NEXT_PRIORITIES.md`
- `ROADMAP.md`
- All `STATUS_*.md` files
- Any markdown files under `docs/`
- Module‑specific TODO sections (e.g., `*/README.md` with `- [ ]` items)

## Workflow Overview
1. **Document Analysis**
   - Scan each target file for markdown task items (`- [ ]`).
   - Record tasks that have **more than five** items; smaller files can be handled manually.
2. **Issue Creation**
   - For each task item:
     - Derive a concise title (first few words of the description).
     - Choose a label based on the task type (e.g., `documentation`, `enhancement`, `bug`).
     - Populate the Issue body with:
       - Original task description.
       - A reference link to the source file and line number.
   - Use the GitHub API (`POST /repos/:owner/:repo/issues`).
3. **Document Cleanup**
   - Replace the original markdown task line with a reference to the newly created Issue, e.g.:
     ```markdown
     - [ ] Implement rate limiting for API endpoints <!-- #123 -->
     ```
   - If a task is no longer needed, simply delete the line.
4. **Verification**
   - Run a script that confirms every `<!-- #<num> -->` comment maps to an existing Issue.
   - Ensure no remaining `- [ ]` items remain in the processed documents.

## Success Metrics
- **10+ documents** processed.
- **≥50** tasks converted to Issues.
- **Zero** remaining task lists in the source documents.
- All Issues have clear acceptance criteria and appropriate labels.

## Quality Standards
- **Uniqueness** – No duplicate Issues for the same task.
- **Traceability** – Every Issue references its source location.
- **Documentation** – Updated files contain a short note linking back to the Issue.

## Example
**Before** (`docs/PLAN.md`):
```markdown
## TODO Items
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] Add authentication to webhook handlers
- [ ] Create deployment documentation
```
**After** (`docs/PLAN.md`):
```markdown
## TODO Items
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API endpoints <!-- #42 -->
- [ ] Add authentication to webhook handlers <!-- #43 -->
- [ ] Create deployment documentation <!-- #44 -->
```
Corresponding Issues:
- #42 – "🚀 SECURITY: Implement rate limiting for API endpoints"
- #43 – "🔐 SECURITY: Add authentication to webhook handlers"
- #44 – "📚 DOCS: Create deployment documentation"

## Non‑Destructive Guarantee
The process never deletes content permanently; it only adds Issue references and comments. Original task text remains untouched, allowing a manual rollback if needed.
