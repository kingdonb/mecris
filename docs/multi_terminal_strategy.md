# Multi‑Terminal Claude Code Strategy

**Goal:** Enable reliable, cost‑effective use of Claude Code across the five Mecris projects (Mecris, AWS‑Accounts, NoClaude, Cozystack, Urmanac) by running concurrent terminals, an orchestrator, and intelligent request routing.

---

## 1. Scenario Overview
A developer launches three Claude Code terminals:
- **Team 1** – works on a specific set of tasks (e.g., feature A).
- **Team 2** – tackles a different set (e.g., feature B).
- **Orchestrator** – watches both, validates deliverables, updates a shared plan, and issues next‑action feedback.

After each checkpoint the orchestrator inspects outputs, copies/pastes needed adjustments, and pushes a concise “next‑action” list back to the teams.

---

## 2. Orchestrator Workflow
| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Pull plan** | `git pull` / read `plan.md` |
| **Validate** | Compare each team’s output folder against expected artifacts (via simple diff or custom validator). |
| **Summarize** | Generate a short status report and list missing or broken items. |
| **Update & Notify** | Commit updates, push, and alert the terminals (e.g., via a terminal‑wide message or Slack webhook). |
| **Repeat** | Triggered manually or on a cron schedule after the next checkpoint. |

---

## 3. API Multiplexing (Groq ↔ Anthropic)
- Deploy two independent `claude-code-proxy` instances:
  - **Proxy A** → free Groq endpoint.
  - **Proxy B** → paid Anthropic endpoint (uses remaining credits).
- A thin routing script (`router.sh`) selects a proxy based on credit status retrieved from the `/usage` endpoint:
```bash
CREDITS=$(curl -s http://localhost:8000/usage | jq .credits_remaining)
if (( CREDITS > 1000 )); then
  export CLAUDE_PROXY=http://localhost:8001   # Anthropic
else
  export CLAUDE_PROXY=http://localhost:8002   # Groq
fi
claude-code "$@"
```
- The orchestrator can query this endpoint at each checkpoint, ensuring we exhaust paid credits before they expire while falling back to the free tier automatically.

---

## 4. Minimal Kubernetes Footprint
We run **three lightweight pods** (Groq, Anthropic, spare) behind a single `Service`. The heavy lifting—retries, circuit‑breakers, dynamic routing—is delegated to a **service mesh** (e.g., Istio or Linkerd). The mesh silently intercepts requests and:
- Retries transient failures.
- Opens circuit‑breakers when a backend approaches rate limits.
- Reroutes traffic to the spare pod or switches between Groq/Anthropic based on the routing script.

> *The exact mesh configuration is intentionally abstracted; the key point is that the mesh guarantees “tortoise” reliability without exposing the plumbing.*

---

## 5. Anxiety / Anger Transparency Spectrum
| Transparency | Experience | Trade‑off |
|--------------|------------|----------|
| **High** (live logs) | Low anxiety, but can feel invasive and waste credits. | Over‑exposure to quota drain. |
| **Medium** (periodic checkpoints) | Balanced control → moderate anxiety, moderate anger. | Requires disciplined orchestrator, but catches most regressions early. |
| **Low** (final deliverables only) | Fast, hands‑off, but hidden failures → spikes in anger when output breaks. | Missed early error detection, higher risk of wasted credits. |

We adopt **medium transparency**: the orchestrator posts concise status updates (e.g., “Team 1: 3/5 tasks done, 2 failures”) while raw logs remain in a private artifact store for debugging only when needed.

---

## 6. Conclusion
By combining:
- **Concurrent terminals** with an orchestrator, 
- **Credit‑aware API multiplexing**,
- **A minimal Kubernetes deployment** backed by a service mesh for automatic retries and routing,
- **Medium‑level transparency** to keep anxiety low without sacrificing control,

we can reliably leverage the free Groq tier, safely consume remaining Anthropic credits, and keep all five Mecris projects progressing without visible overhead. The “tortoise” (stable free tier) is kept productive, while the “hare” (paid credits) is used sparingly but effectively.
