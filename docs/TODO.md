## Notes

### Budget Constraints
- **Current**: $6.82 remaining until August 5, 2025 (24 hours)
- **Today's Spend**: $3.28 (excellent ROI - ob_mirror monitoring + 6-goal context)
- **Target**: Spend at least $3 more today to hit spending goals
- **Strategy**: Focus on dog walking reminder system - immediate user value
- **Monitoring**: Real-time burn rate tracking with SMS alerts

### Development Philosophy
- **Production-first**: Build robust, tested components
- **Manual fallbacks**: Graceful degradation when automation fails
- **Budget-conscious**: Every feature justified by value/cost ratio
- **Test-driven**: Comprehensive validation before deployment
