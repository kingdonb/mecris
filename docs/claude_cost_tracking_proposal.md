# Mecris Claude Cost Tracking System - Proposal

## Objective
Implement a robust, real-time budget tracking and planning system for Mecris MCP server that:
- Tracks Claude API usage in near-real-time
- Enables budget-aware activity planning
- Provides granular insights into token consumption
- Supports dynamic budget allocation and estimation

## Key Components

### 1. Anthropic Organization Integration
- Obtain Admin API key for organization access
- Set up programmatic usage and cost tracking
- Implement secure key management

### 2. Budget Tracking Script
- Develop a script to:
  - Fetch usage data at configurable intervals
  - Calculate current spend
  - Project remaining budget
  - Track token consumption by model and service

### 3. MCP Server Endpoint
- Create `/usage` endpoint exposing:
  - Current budget
  - Tokens consumed
  - Estimated time remaining
  - Spending rate
  - Projected budget exhaustion

### 4. Planning and Estimation Logic
- Develop algorithm to:
  - Distribute budget across time window
  - Estimate task costs
  - Adjust activity scope based on remaining budget
  - Provide recommendations for optimization

## Technical Specifications
- Polling frequency: Once per minute
- Data granularity: 1-minute intervals
- Error handling for API fluctuations
- Secure, configurable budget thresholds

## Success Criteria
- Accurate budget tracking within Â±5% of actual spend
- Real-time budget status updates
- Ability to dynamically adjust activities
- Comprehensive logging and reporting

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-project budget allocation
- Historical trend analysis
- Predictive budgeting models

## Open Questions
- How to handle unexpected high-cost tasks?
- What are the precise budget constraints for the next 24 hours?
