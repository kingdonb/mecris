# ðŸš€ Mecris Roadmap

*Strategic priorities toward autonomous SMS accountability system*

## Vision Statement

**Long-term Vision**: Mecris as an invisible, always-available accountability partner accessible entirely through SMS. Users interact naturally via text messages with an intelligent system that understands their goals, constraints, and context without requiring any technical knowledge.

## Current State â†’ Future State

| Aspect | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Interface** | Claude Code CLI | SMS conversation |
| **Operation** | Manual sessions | Autonomous 24/7 |
| **Deployment** | Local development | Production containers |
| **User Experience** | Technical setup required | Pure SMS interaction |
| **Decision Making** | Human-guided | Intelligent automation |

## Strategic Milestones

### Phase 1: Production Foundation (Q4 2025)
**Goal**: Robust, deployable system with autonomous capabilities

#### High Priority Issues
- [#14 Complete Mecris Production Formalization](https://github.com/kingdonb/mecris/issues/14)
- [#11 Implement Autonomous EC2 Deployment System](https://github.com/kingdonb/mecris/issues/11)
- [#13 Implement Dog Walking Reminder System](https://github.com/kingdonb/mecris/issues/13)

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Docker containerization complete
- [ ] Automatic deployment to EC2 working
- [ ] Basic SMS notifications operational
- [ ] System runs autonomously for 5-hour daily window
- [ ] Zero-downtime deployments implemented

### Phase 2: SMS Interface Development (Q1 2026)
**Goal**: Full conversational SMS interface with natural language processing

#### Planned Features
- **Bidirectional SMS**: Users can send questions and receive contextual responses
- **Conversation Memory**: System remembers context across multiple message exchanges
- **Natural Language**: Responses feel conversational, not robotic
- **Message Queue**: Asynchronous processing with priority handling

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can check goal status via SMS
- [ ] System responds intelligently to free-form questions
- [ ] Conversation context preserved across sessions
- [ ] Message processing handles high volume efficiently

### Phase 3: Advanced Intelligence (Q2 2026)
**Goal**: Sophisticated decision making and personalized guidance

#### Planned Features
- **Predictive Insights**: Anticipate problems before they become urgent
- **Personalized Coaching**: Tailored advice based on behavior patterns
- **Multi-source Integration**: Calendar, email, and other data sources
- **Advanced Heuristics**: Complex decision making without constant API usage

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] System provides proactive guidance
- [ ] Recommendations improve measurably over time
- [ ] Integration with 5+ external data sources
- [ ] Users report increased goal achievement rates

## Current Sprint Priorities

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Documentation Architecture** - Complete permanent doc structure (#15)
2. **Issue Migration** - Convert remaining planning docs to GitHub issues
3. **Production Planning** - Begin containerization work (#14)

### Short-term (Next 2-4 Weeks)
1. **Dog Walking System** - Implement budget-independent reminders (#13)
2. **Autonomous Deployment** - Basic EC2 automation (#11)
3. **Enhanced Integration** - Tamagotchi and Stakpak integration (#12)

### Medium-term (Next 2-3 Months)
1. **SMS Foundation** - Basic SMS conversation interface
2. **Production Hardening** - Monitoring, alerting, security audit
3. **Performance Optimization** - Cost reduction and efficiency improvements

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Uptime**: 99.9% during operational hours
- **Response Time**: <2 seconds for SMS responses
- **Cost Efficiency**: <$5/month operational costs
- **Error Rate**: <1% failed operations

### User Experience Metrics
- **Adoption**: Users prefer SMS interface over technical tools
- **Engagement**: Increased frequency of goal-related interactions
- **Effectiveness**: Measurable improvement in goal achievement
- **Satisfaction**: Users report system feels helpful, not annoying

### Strategic Metrics
- **Autonomy**: System operates 7+ days without manual intervention
- **Intelligence**: Appropriate responses in 95%+ of conversational exchanges
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports multiple users without major changes
- **Maintainability**: New features can be added without breaking existing functionality

## Dependencies & Risks

### External Dependencies
- **Twilio SMS Service**: Reliable message delivery platform
- **AWS Infrastructure**: Cost-effective computing resources
- **Claude API**: Budget management for enhanced intelligence
- **Third-party APIs**: Beeminder, weather, calendar services

### Risk Mitigation
- **Budget Constraints**: Graceful degradation when API budget exhausted
- **Service Outages**: Offline operation modes and cached responses
- **Scalability**: Architecture designed for growth from day one
- **User Adoption**: Focus on solving real problems with simple interface
