  🔎 Recommendations

  - Address critical Beeminder goals immediately – focus on ellinika and
  arabiya.
  - Prioritize highest‑value work given the budget shortfall; defer
  low‑impact tasks.
  - Record Groq usage if it hasn’t been updated this week (helps keep cost
  tracking accurate).

  Let me know which item you’d like to tackle first, or if you need more
  detail on any goal or budget metric.

> Why not explain what you're trying to do there? The MCP server is working fine, isn't it? (Do you have the GitHub MCP still? Can you see kingdonb/mecris
 issues?) There was a weird issue, where some new issue seemingly related to Mecris popped up in the kingdon-ci/kaniko-builder repository. Can you be a
bit careful using tools? Let me know what you're doing before you start diving into scripts, alright?

⏺ 🗂️ Updated Mecris snapshot

  - Active goals: 5
  - Beeminder alerts:
    - arabiya – derails in 2 days (CAUTION)
    - ellinika – derails in 2 days (CAUTION)

  - Budget: ‑25 days remaining → WARNING (period ends 2025‑09‑30)
  - Daily walk: logged ✅

  📌 Immediate actions (from the todo list)

  1. Arabiya – check the latest datapoints, add any missing data, and update the goal if possible.
  2. Ellinika – perform the same steps as for arabiya.
  3. Budget – review the budget status and decide which lower‑priority work can be postponed.
  4. Groq usage – verify whether a usage reading has been recorded this week; if not, record it.

  Let me know which of these you’d like to start with, or if you need more detail on any specific goal or the budget.

> That all looks correct. We're doing better than when I first checked with you today. That's great - your job is doing, it's working, you did it - I went
 for the walk! Before you even reminded me. That's amazing. You're even smarter than you think. Now what about that MCP server - if you try to read the
GitHub issues from kingdonb/mecris can you see them? (If that fails, can you try kingdon-ci/kaniko-builder and let me know if that one works?)
