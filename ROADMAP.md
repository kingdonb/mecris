# 🗺️ MECRIS ROADMAP 2025

> **Mission**: Transform Mecris from reactive MCP server to autonomous cognitive agent with rich contextual awareness

## 📊 Current Status
- **Budget**: $23.19 remaining (43 days @ $30/month ceiling)
- **Foundation**: Production-ready MCP server with Beeminder, Budget, and Twilio integrations ✅
- **Gap**: No autonomous wake-up/nagging capability — *this is the core missing piece*

---

## 🎯 Four Core Goals

### **GOAL 1: Autonomous Deployment & Nagging System** 🚨
**Priority**: HIGHEST | **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks | **Budget Impact**: ~$2-3

**Current Problem**: You're "doing very poorly" at daily walks despite having all the tracking infrastructure in place. Mecris has Twilio, it knows your goals, but it doesn't autonomously wake up to check on you.

**Solution**: Deploy autonomous scheduler that:
- Runs periodic health checks (cron-based or containerized scheduler)
- Evaluates narrator context using heuristic functions
- Makes autonomous decisions about when to send Twilio notifications
- Implements intelligent nagging logic (frequency, urgency, context-aware messaging)

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Containerized periodic check system (Docker + scheduler)
- [ ] Heuristic decision engine for notification triggers
- [ ] Smart nagging algorithms (time-of-day, goal urgency, success patterns)
- [ ] Web dashboard for check-in status (optional, lightweight)

**Infrastructure**: Build on existing FastAPI server + Twilio integration

### **GOAL 2: Knowledge Base & RAG Integration** 📚
**Priority**: HIGH | **Timeline**: 4-6 weeks | **Budget Impact**: ~$3-5

**Vision**: Transform Mecris documentation and personal context into a conversational knowledge base using Obelisk framework.

**Approach**: Don't reinvent the wheel — use Obelisk's proven Obsidian→Docs→RAG pipeline.

**Solution Components**:
- Convert existing `/docs` and personal Obsidian vault to structured knowledge base
- Separate public docs (publishable) from private context (work notes, personal details, PII)
- Implement "conversation with your docs" capability integrated with current Claude Code experience
- Local inference preferred (privacy + cost) with cloud fallback for complex queries

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Mecris documentation structured for Obelisk processing
- [ ] Private context integration (work notes, personal data) with PII protection
- [ ] RAG query interface integrated with narrator context
- [ ] Local model deployment pipeline (budget-conscious)

**Budget Strategy**: Prioritize open-source/local solutions, cloud APIs only for complex reasoning

### **GOAL 3: Chrome Bookmarks Context Integration** 🔖
**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Timeline**: 3-4 weeks | **Budget Impact**: ~$1-2

**Vision**: Your browsing history becomes part of Mecris's contextual awareness — find that thing you bookmarked based on vague descriptions.

**Technical Approach**:
- Direct JSON file reading from `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Bookmarks`
- Chronological organization analysis (leverage your existing bookmark organization patterns)
- Semantic search over bookmark titles/URLs + optional content indexing for key bookmarks
- Integration with narrator context for reading pattern insights

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Chrome bookmarks JSON parser and MCP endpoint integration
- [ ] Semantic search capability for "find that thing I bookmarked"
- [ ] Reading pattern analysis for narrator context insights
- [ ] Optional: content indexing for high-value bookmarked pages

**Cost Efficiency**: Local processing + lightweight embedding models

---

### **GOAL 4: AI Coding Framework Formalization** 🛠️
**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks | **Budget Impact**: ~$0-1

**Current State**: Using Claude Code successfully, but no formal evaluation of alternatives.

**Goal**: Make informed decision about long-term development approach — stick with Claude Code or adopt agent framework.

**Evaluation Targets**:
- Current: Claude Code (known working solution)
- Alternatives: Aider, Cursor, Open Interpreter, AutoGPT-style frameworks
- Criteria: Cost efficiency, code quality, integration with Mecris architecture

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Formal evaluation framework for AI coding tools
- [ ] Proof-of-concept implementations using 2-3 alternative frameworks
- [ ] Cost-benefit analysis aligned with <$30/month constraint
- [ ] Decision document and implementation plan for chosen approach

**Philosophy**: "If there's an established framework that does better what we already do, let's use it"

## 📅 Implementation Timeline

**Weeks 1-3: Autonomous Deployment** (CRITICAL PATH)
- Week 1: Design autonomous scheduler architecture
- Week 2: Implement core nagging system with Twilio integration  
- Week 3: Deploy, test, and refine heuristic decision making

**Weeks 2-4: AI Framework Evaluation** (PARALLEL)
- Week 2: Survey and shortlist alternatives to Claude Code
- Week 3: Build proof-of-concepts with top 2-3 candidates
- Week 4: Make decision and document transition plan if needed

**Weeks 4-8: Knowledge Base Integration**
- Weeks 4-5: Obelisk integration and docs structuring
- Weeks 6-7: RAG implementation with local inference priority
- Week 8: Integration testing and private context security validation

**Weeks 6-10: Chrome Integration**
- Weeks 6-7: Chrome bookmarks parser and basic search
- Weeks 8-9: Semantic search and narrator context integration
- Week 10: Reading pattern analysis and insights

## 💰 Budget Projection

| Goal | Estimated Cost | Justification |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| Autonomous Deployment | $2-3 | Minimal cloud resources, mostly cron/local scheduling |
| Knowledge Base/RAG | $3-5 | Local inference setup, occasional cloud API usage for complex queries |
| Chrome Integration | $1-2 | Local processing, lightweight embeddings |
| Framework Evaluation | $0-1 | Research phase, minimal API costs for testing |
| **TOTAL** | **$6-11** | Well within 43-day budget of $23.19 |

**Risk Mitigation**: Start with local/free solutions, add cloud capabilities only when proven necessary.

## 🎖️ Success Metrics

**Goal 1 Success**: You actually get nagged about walks and respond to the nagging
**Goal 2 Success**: You can ask Mecris "what did I decide about X?" and get accurate answers from your docs
**Goal 3 Success**: You can ask "find that article about Y" and Mecris locates it from your bookmarks  
**Goal 4 Success**: Development velocity increases measurably with chosen framework

## 🚧 Future Considerations

- **AWS Account Terraform Module**: Mentioned but deferred — security-first cloud infrastructure for eventual scaling
- **Multi-user Support**: Architected for single-user but considering friend/neighbor sharing
- **Advanced Scheduling**: Beyond daily nagging — project deadline management, goal sprint planning

**Next Action**: Begin Goal 1 implementation — the autonomous nagging system that will finally get you walking daily. 🚶‍♂️
