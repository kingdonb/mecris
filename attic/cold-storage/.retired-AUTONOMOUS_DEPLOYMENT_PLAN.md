# Retirement Record: AUTONOMOUS_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md

**Retirement Date**: 2025-10-19
**Retired By**: GitHub Copilot / Kingdon Barrett

## Original Purpose
Comprehensive implementation plan for deploying autonomous nagging system on ephemeral AWS EC2 infrastructure with 5-hour daily operational window, SMS notifications, and stateless operation.

## Issues Addressed
- GitHub Issue #11 - Implement Autonomous EC2 Deployment System (OPEN)

## Information Migration
- **Core architecture** → Migrated to GitHub Issue #11 with full implementation details
- **Technical requirements** → Preserved in issue for development tracking
- **EC2 configuration** → Will be migrated to `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` upon issue completion
- **SMS integration specs** → Will be consolidated into `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **User data scripts** → Implementation details tracked in GitHub issue
- **Heuristic decision engine** → Specifications preserved in issue for implementation

## Verification
- [x] All content preserved in GitHub Issue #11
- [x] No remaining TODOs or FIXMEs lose actionable information
- [x] Implementation plan trackable through GitHub issues
- [x] No active dependencies on original file confirmed
- [ ] Deployment procedures will be migrated to permanent docs upon implementation
- [ ] Architecture information will be consolidated into `ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Notes
This document represented detailed implementation planning for the autonomous SMS accountability vision. All actionable items are now tracked in GitHub Issue #11. Upon completion of the implementation, operational procedures will be documented in the permanent documentation tree (`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`).
