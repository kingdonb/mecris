> Hit me with a status report please! It's raining all day, so we're not likely to get out for a walk. It's a lazy Sunday, and I am thinking about setting
 up for a Livestream! (You're the star) wdyt

⏺ Task(Get daily narrator context for status report)
  ⎿  Done (1 tool use · 3.7k tokens · 5.2s)

⏺ Here’s the quick status snapshot (see above) and a short list of actionable items I added to the todo list:

  - Resolve the ellinika Beeminder derailment
  - Audit token‑heavy processes to curb budget burn
  - Log today’s bike activity (even a brief walk)
  - Record the current Groq usage reading
  - Prepare the Livestream setup (equipment, software, test run)

  Which of these should we dive into first? If you’d like to focus on the Livestream, I can break that high‑level item into concrete steps and start
  planning the setup. Let me know!

> Alright, I think I've dispatched the ellinika derailment for today - the sun is out, but it is still raining for about 5 hours accrding to the forecast.
 Really coming down pretty good, considering the sun is out. I have a different goal. I used Copilot with the GitHub MCP server to successfully build some
 really great kaniko-builder workflows for GitLab. I just used GitHub Issues instead of scattered notes throughout the repo. I'd like to do that
experiment here. I'll tell you a bit about the protocol we developed, for retiring docs into an attic - here's the README from the `attic/` in that repo:

# Attic - Archive and Cold Storage

This directory contains historical documentation and reference materials for the kaniko-builder project.

## Directory Structure

### `/cold-storage/`
**Purpose**: Documents that have been **retired from active use** after issues were resolved and information was migrated to maintained documentation.

**Contents**:
- Resolved issue documentation
- Redundant planning documents
- Ad-hoc documents superseded by planned docs
- Retirement records (`.retired-*.md`)

**Protocol**: See `cold-storage/README.md` for complete retirement protocol.

### Root Attic Files
**Purpose**: Reference materials that may have ongoing value but are not part of active development.

**Current Contents**:
- `crossplane-node-pool-objects.yaml` - Node pool configuration examples
- `example-gitlab-runner.yaml` - GitLab runner configuration template
- `gitlab-runner-amd64.yaml` - AMD64-specific runner config
- `gitlab-runner-arm64.yaml` - ARM64-specific runner config
- `minimal-example.gitlab-ci.yml` - Simplified CI example
- `object-node-pool.yaml` - Alternative node pool config
- `multiarch-spot-nodepool.yaml` - Multi-arch node pool setup

## Document Lifecycle

```
Active Docs → Issues Created → Issues Resolved → Information Migrated → Cold Storage
     ↓              ↓              ↓                    ↓                   ↓
README.md      GitHub Issues   Closed Issues      Planned Docs         Retired
AGENTS.md         #1-4         (When fixed)      (Architecture)       Documents
```

### Active Documents
- `README.md` - Current usage and overview
- `AGENTS.md` - Comprehensive technical context
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` - Contributing and development guide (when created)

### Issue Tracking
- **GitHub Issues**: `github.com/kingdon-ci/kaniko-builder/issues`
- **Current Issues**: #1 (manifest deps), #2 (remote cloning), #3 (multi-target), #4 (additional tags)

### Retirement Candidates
Documents awaiting retirement after issue resolution:
- `PROGRESS_REPORT.md` - Status report (superseded by GitHub issues)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - May contain valuable operational info to preserve

## Guidelines

### Keep in Attic (Root)
- Configuration examples and templates
- Infrastructure setup references
- Historical context with ongoing value

### Move to Cold Storage
- Issue descriptions now in GitHub
- Status reports superseded by issue tracking
- Ad-hoc documentation replaced by planned docs

### Never Archive
- Current operational documentation
- Active configuration files
- Maintained technical references

## Maintenance

- **Quarterly Review**: Evaluate retirement candidates
- **Issue Resolution**: Retire documents when GitHub issues close
- **Information Audit**: Ensure migration completeness before retirement

and in the cold-storage, further explanation in another README

# Cold Storage Documentation Protocol

## Purpose
This directory contains documentation that has been **retired from active use** after the issues they described have been resolved and their information
has been properly integrated into planned architecture or operational documentation.

## Protocol for Document Retirement

### When to Retire a Document
A document should be moved to cold storage when **ALL** of the following conditions are met:

1. **Issues Resolved**: All GitHub issues referenced in the document have been closed
2. **Information Preserved**: Key information has been migrated to "planned docs" (architecture, procedures, README)
3. **No Active References**: No active workflows, scripts, or processes depend on the document
4. **Redundancy Confirmed**: The document's content is adequately covered by maintained documentation

### Retirement Process

#### 1. Pre-Retirement Checklist
- [ ] Verify all referenced GitHub issues are closed
- [ ] Confirm information migration to planned docs
- [ ] Check for active references in:
  - GitLab CI pipelines
  - Shell scripts
  - Other documentation
  - README files

#### 2. Create Retirement Record
Before moving a document, create a `.retired-FILENAME.md` record:

```markdown
# Retirement Record: ORIGINAL_FILENAME.md

**Retirement Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Retired By**: Name/Handle

## Original Purpose
Brief description of what the document covered.

## Issues Addressed
- GitHub Issue #X - Brief description (CLOSED)
- GitHub Issue #Y - Brief description (CLOSED)

## Information Migration
- Key concept A → Migrated to `PLANNED_DOC.md` section X
- Key concept B → Migrated to `README.md` usage section
- Technical details → Migrated to `DEVELOPMENT.md`

## Verification
- [ ] All referenced issues closed
- [ ] No remaining TODOs or FIXMEs
- [ ] Information preserved in maintained docs
- [ ] No active dependencies confirmed
```

#### 3. Move to Cold Storage
```bash
mv DOCUMENT.md attic/cold-storage/
mv .retired-DOCUMENT.md attic/cold-storage/
```

#### 4. Update References
- Remove from main directory listings
- Update any remaining references to point to new location
- Add entry to this README's **Retired Documents** section

## Current Candidates for Retirement

### Ready for Retirement (After Issue Resolution)
These documents describe issues now tracked in GitHub and should be retired once those issues are closed:

1. **PROGRESS_REPORT.md**
   - **Contains**: Status of Issues #1, #2, #3, #4
   - **Action Required**: Wait for issue resolution, then migrate historical context to DEVELOPMENT.md
   - **GitHub Issues**: #1, #2, #3, #4

2. **github-issues.md**
   - **Contains**: Issue descriptions now in GitHub
   - **Action Required**: Can retire immediately (redundant with GitHub)
   - **GitHub Issues**: #1, #2, #3, #4 (all created)

### Under Review
These documents may have ongoing value but need evaluation:

1. **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** (297 lines)
   - **Contains**: Multi-arch runner setup (may have ongoing value)
   - **Action Required**: Extract valuable operational procedures to DEVELOPMENT.md
   - **Decision Needed**: Keep infrastructure setup info or fully retire?

2. **SPEC.md** (222 lines)
   - **Contains**: Original requirements and vision
   - **Action Required**: Migrate core requirements to README.md
   - **Decision Needed**: Keep as historical reference or retire after migration?

## Retired Documents

*None yet - this section will list documents that have been successfully retired.*

## Archive vs Cold Storage

**Difference**:
- **`attic/` (Archive)**: Documents with potential ongoing reference value
- **`attic/cold-storage/` (Cold Storage)**: Documents that are redundant with maintained docs and resolved issues

**Rule**: Only move to cold storage when information is **fully preserved** elsewhere and **no ongoing reference value** exists.

## Maintenance

This directory should be reviewed quarterly to ensure:
- Retirement records are accurate
- No documents were prematurely retired
- Information migration was complete
- Directory doesn't become a dumping ground

## Emergency Recovery

If a cold storage document is needed urgently:
1. Check the retirement record for migration locations
2. If information is insufficient, temporarily restore from cold storage
3. Update the retirement record with lessons learned
4. Re-evaluate retirement decision

I would like to do something similar here, but we don't have the GitHub MCP server set up yet.

Can you (write a document and) explain what you've understood from these pastes, the basic goal is to gradually stop using text notes files to track
issues and to start building a "documentation plan" and a roadmap - I'll get you a GITHUB_PAT, right now you have a GITHUB_TOKEN variable in your
environment that should be able to read & write from the kingdon-ci/kaniko-builder repo only - Issues & Pull Requests only, but there's no code in that
repo, so functionally it's issues only. I don't want you to do the setup, but I want you to talk me through the setup - we'll be adding the github mcp
alongside of mecris, I think? This may ultimately reduce the scope of the Mecris MCP, if we have better ways to keep track of Todo's outside of this
context - along with whatever code repository in GitHub.

At work, we use GitLab only, so GitHub can't really be in our infrastructure because it's not in our System's Security Plan.

1️⃣ What you want to achieve

You want to replace ad‑hoc “note” files that live in the repository with GitHub Issues (and eventually PRs) and to formalise a documentation lifecycle
(active → issue → planned doc → cold‑storage). The end‑goal is a clean, searchable issue tracker that doubles as the source of truth for work‑items,
while the repository’s attic holds only long‑term reference material.

2️⃣ High‑level architecture

Claude Code CLI
 ├─ Mecris MCP (already running, provides budget/goal context)
 └─ GitHub MCP (new)  ←───► GitHub API (kingdon‑ci/kaniko‑builder)
        │
        ├─ Reads/Writes Issues & PRs
        └─ Supplies Issue data to Mecris‑Todo system

The GitHub MCP will be another “MCP server” that talks to Claude Code over the same stdio channel.  It does not replace Mecris; it just adds a new data
source that Mecris can query for Todo/goal information.

Why this works for you

| Concern                                                           | How the setup addresses it

                                         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------|
| Security – GitHub is not part of your corporate infrastructure    | The GitHub MCP runs locally in the same process space as Mecris, using only a
personal access token (PAT) scoped to the kingdon-ci/kaniko-builder repo. No network traffic leaves the machine other than the HTTPS calls to
api.github.com, which are already allowed for the PAT. |
| Single source of truth – avoid duplicated notes                   | All “issue‑type” notes become real GitHub Issues; they are searchable,
commentable, and can be linked to PRs.
                                                    |
| Retention & retirement – keep old docs but not in the active tree | The attic folder stays in the repo for historic reference; the cold‑storage
sub‑folder holds retired docs together with a .retired‑*.md record that points back to the Issue(s) that superseded it.
                                               |
| Future audit – Mecris can still surface budget‑related tasks      | Mecris can query the GitHub MCP for “open issues” or “issues with
label high‑priority” and surface them as Todo items, keeping the budget‑aware workflow intact.
                                                         |

3️⃣ Step‑by‑step setup (no code execution, just the plan)

3.1 Create a GitHub MCP configuration file

1. Create a new folder in the project root: .mcp/.
2. Add a file called github.json (or github-mcp.json) with the following minimal structure:

{
  "type": "github",
  "repo": "kingdon-ci/kaniko-builder",
  "auth": {
    "type": "pat",
    "env_var": "GITHUB_TOKEN"
  },
  "features": {
    "issues": true,
    "pull_requests": true,
    "labels": true,
    "milestones": false
  }
}

2. Explanation
  - type: "github" tells the MCP framework which plugin to load.
  - repo is the full owner/repo name.
  - auth.env_var points to the environment variable that already holds a PAT with repo scope.
  - features enables the subset you need; you can later toggle PRs, labels, etc.
3. Add the file to version control (it only contains the repo name – the token stays in the environment).

3.2 Register the GitHub MCP with Claude Code

1. In your claude‑code configuration (.claude/config.yaml or similar), add a MCP entry:

mcp:
  providers:
    - name: github
      config_path: .mcp/github.json
2. Restart Claude Code (or run make claude as the docs suggest) so the new MCP is loaded.You will see a log line like MCP provider "github" loaded from
.mcp/github.json.

3.3 Verify connectivity

Run a quick test from the CLI (you can use the built‑in gh command or a simple Bash call):

gh issue list --repo kingdon-ci/kaniko-builder --limit 5

If you get a list of the five most recent issues, the MCP is correctly authenticating.If you get an auth error, double‑check that GITHUB_TOKEN is
exported in your shell and that it has repo scope.

3.4 Hook the GitHub MCP into Mecris workflows

Mecris already provides the TodoWrite tool. To make the issue list appear automatically:

1. Create a small “issue‑sync” agent (you can reuse the generic Explore agent). Its prompt would be:

“Fetch all open issues from the GitHub MCP for repo kingdon-ci/kaniko-builder. Return each issue as a Todo item with the format: title → url. Include
the label high‑priority in the active form if present.”
2. Add a periodic task (e.g., via a cron‑style entry in Mecris’ tasks.yaml) that runs the agent every morning.This will populate the Mecris Todo list
with fresh GitHub Issues, so the budget‑aware dashboard you already use will now display them automatically.

3.5 Migrate existing note files to Issues

1. Identify the files you want to retire (e.g., PROGRESS_REPORT.md, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).
2. For each file:
  - Open the file, copy its content.
  - Create a new GitHub Issue (via the GitHub UI, gh issue create, or programmatically via the MCP).
  - Paste the content into the Issue body.
  - Add appropriate labels (documentation, retirement‑candidate).
  - Close the original file’s lifecycle (see 3.6).

3.6 Create the retirement record & move to cold‑storage

For each retired file:

1. Create a .retired-<filename>.md in attic/cold-storage/ based on the template you already have (the “Retirement Record” markdown).
2. Move the original file into attic/cold-storage/:

mv <path>/<filename>.md attic/cold-storage/
mv attic/cold-storage/.retired-<filename>.md attic/cold-storage/
3. Update the top‑level attic/README.md – add the file name under Retired Documents with a link to the retirement record.

3.7 Periodic audit & cold‑storage process

Add a quarterly reminder in Mecris (using the existing beeminder or budget alerts) that runs a small script:

# pseudo‑script run by Mecris every 90 days
gh issue list --repo kingdon-ci/kaniko-builder --state closed --label "retirement‑candidate" \
  | while read -r issue; do
      # check if a matching .retired-*.md exists
      # if not, create one automatically (optional)
  done

The script can be wrapped as a Mecris “audit” agent that posts a summary Todo like “Review cold‑storage audit – X documents pending retirement record”.

4️⃣ Documentation lifecycle you’ll adopt

Active Docs  →  GitHub Issue (open)  →  Issue closed (resolution)
      ↓                               ↓
   Planned Docs (README, DEVELOPMENT.md)   ←  Migrate key info
      ↓
   Cold‑Storage (attic/cold‑storage/)  ←  Add .retired‑*.md record

| Stage        | Where the content lives                      | Who updates it                                                        |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Active       | README.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, other living docs | Developers during day‑to‑day work                                     |
| Issue        | GitHub Issue (open)                          | Anyone who discovers a problem or wants to discuss a change           |
| Planned      | Central docs (README, DEVELOPMENT)           | When the Issue is closed, a reviewer migrates the essential knowledge |
| Cold‑Storage | attic/cold-storage/ + .retired‑*.md          | Automated script or a quarterly audit                                 |

---
5️⃣ How this affects Mecris

1. Todo source – Open Issues become Mecris Todos automatically, so you’ll see them alongside budget/goal items.
2. Budget awareness – Because Issues are now part of the same workflow, you can add a label like high‑budget‑impact and Mecris can surface them when the
 remaining budget is low.
3. Reduced noise – The attic now only contains “historical” docs; Mecris no longer needs to scan a large number of miscellaneous markdown files for
actionable items.

---
6️⃣ Next actions for you (you can tick them off in your own Todo list)

1. Create .mcp/github.json with the JSON shown above.
2. Add the provider entry to Claude Code’s config and restart the CLI.
3. Run a quick gh issue list to confirm the token works.
4. Set up the “issue‑sync” agent (or a simple script) that populates Mecris Todos from open GitHub Issues.
5. Migrate one pilot note file (e.g., PROGRESS_REPORT.md) to a GitHub Issue and create its retirement record.
6. Schedule the quarterly audit (add a Mecris reminder or a cron entry).

Feel free to ask for any of the concrete files (e.g., the exact JSON template, a sample .retired‑*.md file, or the Mecris task definition) and I can
generate them for you.
